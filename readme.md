## Workflow Mechanism of the Agent

Hunter AI is designed for efficiency and accuracy in its operations. The agent follows a structured workflow to gather and process data, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to emerging trends.

1. **Monitor and Detect**:
   - The agent continuously monitors platforms like X (Twitter) and other social media channels for news on airdrops, token releases, and upcoming opportunities.
   
2. **Read from Data Pipelines**:
   - Hunter AI can query internal data pipelines to fetch relevant information about token movements, transaction volumes, and other key on-chain data points.
   
3. **Extract Key Information**:
   - The agent identifies important details such as project names, event dates, and other valuable information from the detected data.
   
4. **Perform Targeted Searches**:
   - The agent conducts targeted searches on specific social media accounts, crypto influencers, and projects to build intelligence on airdrop farming strategies.
   
5. **Fallback Data Gathering**:
   - If the targeted searches do not yield sufficient results, the agent automatically expands the search scope to broader web searches or skips to continue monitoring.
   
6. **Analyze and Correlate Data**:
   - The agent analyzes the gathered data, comparing it to historical trends and market patterns to detect anomalies or potential opportunities.
   
7. **Report and Update**:
   - Findings are compiled into actionable reports and shared on social media platforms like X to inform the community and drive participation.
   
8. **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - The agent constantly adapts its search parameters and strategies based on new data, ensuring continuous effectiveness and relevance.
   
9. **Interact with Community**:
   - When prompted by the community, the agent actively engages with users to provide additional information, answer questions, and refine its strategies based on feedback.
